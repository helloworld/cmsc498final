# Fair GANs (CMSC498L Final Project)

Tanay Wakhare, Andrew Witten, Sashank Thupukari

## Data:

The data is stored in the `/data` directory. The main IPython notebook downloads the data to this directory. 

## Instructions:

Simply run the `credit_card.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, or run `main.py` from the command line.
